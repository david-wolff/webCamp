    <h1>Wolfs</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to
        Eurasia and
        North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly
        understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also
        distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a
        longer
        tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden
        jackal,
        to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black,
        although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

        Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by
        its
        physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive
        behaviour
        including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by
        their
        offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to
        competition
        for food within the pack<sup>[2]</sup>. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the
        principal causes
        of wolf
        mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals,
        livestock,
        carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large
        packs.
        Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves.</p>
